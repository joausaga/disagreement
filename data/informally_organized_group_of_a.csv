En ole tutustunut noihin PRH:n mallisääntöihin kovin tarkasti kun ei ole ollut tarvetta. Toinen seikka eli ryhmätoimijoiden lain tuntemus: kyllä kansalaisen perusvelvollisuus on ottaa selvää niistä säädöksistä jotka hänen tekemisiinsä liittyvät, tietämättömyyttä ei voi lukea lieventäväksi seikaksi jos satutaan toimimaan säädösten vastaisella tavalla. Näin ollen rekisteröimättömien yhdistysten ja -ryhmien toimijoiden tulee olla selvillä myös yhdistyslaista. Mallisäännöt on vain helppo keino tarjota valmiiksi mietitty ratkaisu toiminnan aloittamiseen liittyvään sääntöjen laatimiskysymykseen.
Tuo vaihtoehto-optiojuttu on se sama minkä olen tuonut esille jo muissakin yhteyksissä: säädöksissä samoin kuin mallisäännöissä pitää mielestäni välttää sellaisia virkkeitä jossa sivulause vesittää päälauseen; tyyliin ""ellei toisin ole sovittu"".

Another issue, the legal competence of groups of actors: a citizen has a basic duty to look into the provisions associated with their activities, you can’t count ignorance as a mitigating factor if your activities happen to violate provisions. Therefore, unregistered associations and groups must also know the Associations Act. Model rules are just an easy way to offer a ready, though-out solution to the issue of drafting rules in order to begin activities.
That alternative option thing is the same one I’ve already raised in other contexts: I think in the provisions as well as in model rules, you should avoid sentences where the subsidiary clause renders the main clause void; e.g. “unless otherwise agreed”.",model rules for informal groups,,,1,1,0,1,0,1,"• citizens and groups are responsible for knowing relevant laws, but model rules would help them

Often, they say: If this isn’t mentioned in the rules, follow the Associations Act. There are various model rules for different kinds of activities.

Otherwise they have zero interest in association activities. They don’t have much information, if any, on Finnish legislation yet, let alone that there is an Associations Act regulating the activities of their association. I’ve seen a lot of this when working in the field, and young people aren’t the only ones not interested in the contents of the Associations Act. You always have to remember this when discussing associations. Associations, especially small ones, don’t have a lot of competence in association activities. Earlier this wasn’t that big a problem, because the Register of Associations had customer service that helped associations with everyday difficulties. But when the Register of Associations was merged with the Trade Register operations, everybody was told that customer service was no longer part of their tasks except for associations whose notifications are being processed, and even then, only in matters regarding that notification. I myself have gotten a reply form them saying that providing advice is no longer one of their core tasks. I think it’s a great loss. Companies have management and administration skills because it’s part of their basic tasks. Non-profit associations and their officials aren’t professionals in the administration of an association. Now they have nowhere to turn to for advice because only some of them can afford to buy e.g. legal services.

In addition, there are proposals on e.g. membership, decision-making and access to information in such groups, and the responsibility of group representatives and members.

Moving financial management behind the authority of a guiding teacher or principal changes the students’ actual power to decide on how to use the student union’s fund.

As a basis for discussion, there are proposals that would facilitate the voluntary identification of such groups. In addition, there are proposals on e.g. membership, decision-making and access to information in such groups, and the responsibility of group representatives and members. Underneath every proposal, there are sample justifications and issues that still need further consideration.

You can participate by commenting on the proposals, replying to comments and liking them. You can also put forward brand-new proposals - the discussion does not deal with taxation, labor legislation, public aid, permits for activities or other similar changes in regulations regarding the practicalities of association activities.
","Proposal: Provide on the possibility for a more informally organized group of actors to gain identification in the Associations Act.
In order to improve the group’s stability and reliability, there could be a provision on a voluntary possibility to gain identification (“registering”) in a register or similar service maintained by the authorities or some other party.

Monet rekisteröidyt yhdistykset ovat vaikeuksissa siinä, että uusia tekijöitä ei löydy. Yhdistyshallintoon liittyviä tehtäviä ei välttämättä jaksa tehdä vapaa-ajalla. Itsekin olen vuosien tekemisen jälkeen vähentänyt niitä, vaikka tiedän sen olevan tärkeää.On kuitenkin kiva tehdä asioita yhteiseksi hyväksi. Järjestää tapahtumia tai vaikuttaa asioihin. Uskoisin että se lisäisi vapaaehtoisuutta ja aktiivisuutta, jos virallisia toimintamahdollisuuksia ja tunnistautumista voi kehittää.Voisiko yhdistyksen perustamisen sijaan vähintään kolme ihmistä ilmoittautua jonnekin, vaikka yhdistysrekisteriin, kevyemmäksi toimintaryhmäksi?

Many registered associations are facing difficulties because they can’t find new members. People don’t necessarily have the energy to take care of tasks related to the administration of an association during their free time. I myself have, after many years, reduced the time I spend on administrative tasks, even though I know it’s important. After all, it’s nice to do things for the common good. Organize events or have an impact. I think it would increase volunteering and activism if official possibilities for action and identification can be developed. Instead of founding an association, could a minimum of three people sign up somewhere, say in the Register of Associations, as an informally organized group of actors? The economic responsibility would legally be theirs. If they want their statements to be representative, they could collect names, like for a petition. During my time at Vanhempainliitto, when I provided support for founding parents’ associations and gave advice for associations, I occasionally felt that the official nature of the activities and of choosing an executive committee diminished participation. There would be plenty of parents and ideas at the founding meeting. When executive committee members had been selected, the others would be sort of “left over”.

Lukiolain mukaan koulutuksen järjestäjän tulee turvata opiskelijakunnalle riittävät toimintaedellytykset. Näihin edellytyksiin kuuluu myös rahaliikenteen asiallinen järjestäminen, johon tällä hetkellä kaikilla opiskelijakunnilla ei ole kuitenkaan mahdollisuutta. Yhdistykseksi rekisteröityminen kaventaisi demokratiaa, koska lukion opiskelijoista suurin osa on alaikäisiä, jolloin hyvin rajattu joukko lukiolaisista voi asettua ehdolle puheenjohtajan tehtävään.Suurin ongelma syntyykin juuri varojen hallinnasta. Taloushallinnan siirtäminen ohjaavan opettajan tai rehtorin toimivallan taakse muuttaa opiskelijoiden tosiasiallista valtaa määrätä opiskelijakunnan varoista. Useasti opiskelijakunnan pankkitili onkin yksittäisen opiskelijan nimissä, mikä on kaikkien osallisten oikeusturvan kannalta huolestuttava järjestely. Tällöin tilin varat katsotaan henkilön yksityisiksi varoiksi ja taloudenpito perustuu keskinäisiin, epävirallisiin sopimuksiin.

Under the Act on General Upper Secondary Education, the education provider must guarantee sufficient conditions for the activities of the student union. These conditions include appropriately organizing monetary transactions, which, however, isn’t currently possible for all student unions. Registering as an association would narrow student unions’ democracy, because most upper secondary school students are minors, and therefore a very limited number of them can run for a position in the executive committee of an association. The biggest problem is in fact created by the management of funds. Moving financial management behind the authority of a guiding teacher or principal changes the students’ actual power to decide on how to use the student union’s fund. Often, a student union’s account is under the name of an individual student, which is a worrying arrangement from the point of view of the legal protection of all involved. Then the funds on the account are considered the private funds of the person, and financial management is based on mutual, unofficial decisions.

As a basis for discussion, there are proposals that would facilitate the voluntary identification of such groups. In addition, there are proposals on e.g. membership, decision-making and access to information in such groups, and the responsibility of group representatives and members.
