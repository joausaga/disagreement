Minusta on aivan kohtuutonta vapaaehtoisia hallituksen pro bono ihmisiä kohtaan, että miljoonien liikevaihtoa pyörittävässä toiminnassa palkkajohtaja ei vastaa kuin puhelimeen, kaikesta hänen valmistelemastaan ja toimeenpanemastaan vastaa juridisesti hallitus, joka illalla töiden jälkeen tulee pättämään asioista vanhan kahvin ja kuivan pullan palkalla. ( Kärjistän vain vähän.) Oleellista on ymmärtää, ettei toimitusjohtajainstituutiota ole mikään pakko ottaa käyttöön, vaan se olisi vain yksi vaihtoehto niille järjestöille, jossa sitä kaivataan.

However, there are many practical problems, which often arise when the euros and the goods or services don’t meet in planning and implementation. That’s difficult to control with legislation. A typical example is IT projects, where the general meeting blithely sets new operational requirements without understanding the financial impact. The executive committee should then make the members’ dreams come true at the budgeted price. It takes a coolheaded project manager to explain both to the members and to the executive committee that daydreams don’t always come true.

"The administration of an association
In this discussion, the topic is the administration of an association. As a basis for discussion, there are proposals that could e.g. facilitate and clarify the activities of an association’s executive committee. Underneath every proposal, there are sample justifications and issues that still need further consideration.

You can participate by commenting on the proposals, replying to comments and liking them. You can also put forward brand-new proposals - the discussion does not deal with taxation, labor legislation, public aid, permits for activities or other similar changes in regulations regarding the practicalities of association activities.
","Proposal: Mention the possibility of informal decision-making by the executive committee in the Associations Act
In order to facilitate the digitization of associations’ administration and online decision-making, the law could mention as a clarification that the executive committee can also make decisions without a formal meeting, if all members so agree or if the rules so provide.

Jäsenkokouksessa kannattaa jäsenistön myös olla hereillä asioita esitettäessä ja päätöksiä tehtäessä, sillä on aika lailla eri asia jos päätetään kokouksessa summamutikassa että vaikkapa toiminnanohjausjärjestelmään saa käyttää 10 000 euroa, kuin että tehdään kunnolliset esiselvitykset ja tarjouspyyntökierros ennen kokousta, ja kokouksessa vasta päätetään että hankitaan toiminnanohjausjärjestelmä X.

In a members’ meeting, also the members should be alert when motions are proposed and decisions are made, because it’s quite a different matter if the meeting haphazardly decides that, say, 10,000 euros can be spent on an ERP system, than if appropriate preparatory surveys and requests for quotations are made before the meeting, and it is decided only at the meeting that the association will acquire the ERP system X. Even budgeting for such a large acquisition cannot be done sensibly if preparatory surveys and requests for quotes haven’t been done beforehand, before the budgeting decision.

Jos maininta on että ""hallitus voi"", niin silloinhan jokainen yhdistys tekee päätöksen asiasta itselleen sopivasti. Kun tässä keskusteltiin erilaisista yhdistyksistä mm. tekniikan kannalta. Tuohan ei sulje pois sitä, että tietoa pitää tallentaa ja säästää muiden laissa mainittujen sääntöjen mukaan. Tiedon tallennus on jo nyt erilaista. Yhdessä yhdistyksessämme tallensimme pöytäkirjaan tarkkaan kuluneen kuukauden asiat mainintoina hallitukselle myös historian/historiikin näkökulmaa ajatellen. Toisessa taas on tehty päätöspöytäkirjaa. Siitä ei kovin paljon historiaa heru. Mutta näyttöä siitä, että asiat on virallisesti käsitelty.Kannatan sitä, että hallitus voi tehdä kokousten välissä päätöksiä parhaaksi katsomallaan tavalla.

In another, on the other hand, we’ve held minutes just about the decisions. That’s not a great historical source, but it does provide evidence that matters have been discussed and handled officially.
