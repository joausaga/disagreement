Starting from 9/23/2018, all new websites must comply with accessibility requirements. The new digital services of the register of associations will enter into use over the next few months (the date of entry into use was moved some days ago)
So accessibility will also concern the digital services that will be updated based on the new Associations Act. Existing services are inaccessible, so they don’t comply with legal requirements.
Since not all people with disabilities can use digital services, they have to file all notices using paper forms. At present, their prices violate the Non-discrimination Act for people with disabilities:
No disability
Filing a notice of the founding of an association in a digital service €85 (no preliminary rule check by the Patent and Registration Office)
Most people with disabilities
Filing a notice of the founding of an association with a paper form (no preliminary rule check by the Patent and Registration office) €150

I know that the prices have been decided based on what is the quickest and cheapest way for the Patent and Registration Office to handle notices, but notices must not be priced based on handling costs so that they violate the Non-discrimination Act. The situation will be different when the system becomes accessible.

In practice, this has proved to be a bit of a problem, which should be highlighted, and made into a requirement. In its old-fashioned form, an online meeting can be quite long if it’s done in a decentralized way by email, and can be very similar to normal emailing. The main thing is that before a decision is taken, everyone has been informed of the content of the decision and of the alternatives and has been able to express their opinion. So the key point is not to allow or forbid specific kinds of meeting, but to ensure with provisions that the necessary conditions for decision-making are fulfilled, and that they work equitably. Digital meeting method models vary, but we must ensure they are sufficiently in real-time, and that the digital services used are moderately priced and sufficiently commonly used. Holding a meeting completely in real time is, of course, the best solution, but not one all digital tools can deliver in practice. If the association’s meeting is held digitally, a sufficient description of the meeting method should be added as an item in the minutes. Only that way is it possible to evaluate afterwards whether members have had an effective opportunity to affect the meeting and its decisions.

In general, there are problems in several areas of our activities. From a legal standpoint or regarding the possibility of contestation, the most critical problem is the letters or emails sent by the federation to its member associations, for example an invitation to the annual meeting.  Member associations’ contact persons change often, and the official address with them. There have been missing contact details both in the register of associations and in providing new contact details directly to the federation, which is quicker. In one association, we couldn’t find the official recipient with any of the ordinary means from the register of associations or the club’s website or similar, and yet they made a complaint about the message’s arrival. The association’s official contact person had had a non-disclosure of address information, although I’m not sure which services that concerned. If a natural person is a member, it’s up to them whether their contact details are available. What I’m talking about concerns member associations. We just can’t have a situation in which the designated contact person who is the official recipient of all mail does not have any address information available. This situation could be solved by having all associations included in the register of associations have an official online post address with Posti. You could send official material there even though the recipient would change. The system would be even better if it could react simultaneously with the register of associations, so that the same system could also keep a record of those authorized to sign on behalf of associations. Associations would at least react when important mail wouldn’t turn up to the correct recipients but would go to previous committee members. - Licenses ensure that athletes’ information is in the license system, which has the necessary encryption thanks to the professional competence of the Olympic Committee. But in our case, licensed athletes aren’t members of the federation, but of the clubs. According to the rules, we don’t even need to send them official meeting invitations.

In one case, an association’s previous president decided not to cooperate, and threw away the mail that had arrived at the old address without mentioning it to anyone else.

Then all the association’s sets of rules, also those below the organization’s statutes, should state how equality is reflected in its activities. This way, the impact would be also profound and wide-ranging. The general level would be covered by the association’s rules, and the lower-level implementation would be in e.g. competition rules. Equally, then it would also be possible to draw attention to different aspects of equality, such as regional equality, and how that should be visible in the association’s daily work.
- The activities of an association are governed by rules and principles.
- The rules should have a clear hierarchy, and I think the law should consider association statutes (the term I use here is bad and there is some generally accepted and used word for it - what is it?) as the highest level, and administrative and disciplinary rules as the next level. I think it should be a minimum requirement for all associations with over 500 members to have administrative rules in existence. Disciplinary rules should be a requirement at least for organizations with licensed athletes or over 1000 members.
- Because association activities (fortunately) involve a lot more than just rules, you should go beyond rules and somehow also consider the association’s guiding principles. Many of these, too, are often already determined by the organization’s higher-level commitments. So the “Principles of Fair Play in Sport” (rules) are familiar to many, at least on the level of ideas. People with kennels are familiar with “good dog ownership” at least as a term, whatever it means. Also e.g. the Ministry of Education and Culture defines principles that associations are expected to follow.
- I believe the sports arbitration board represents the thought (if I’ve understood correctly) that disciplinary proceedings must take the principles of criminal law into account to the extent that it is appropriate (even though they are by no means criminal proceedings - that’s not what I mean). If you give no thought to those principles, then discipline can go badly wrong.
- I think you could require associations to write down their guiding principles, when you want to refer to them in daily work and decisions. I myself am a firm supporter of writing down principles. Many difficult situations in associations have been solved by assessing the situation by looking at the issue at hand in relation to agreed-upon principles. The worst possible solution usually happens when a situation-specific decision is made without a general policy. That’s why you should spare a section in the law for clarifying the importance of the principles of an association.","Equal treatment, rights, and duties of members",,,0,1,0,0,0,1,"1. require associations’ rules to state e.g.  where and how equality should be manifested

Some may be associations, some companies, some natural persons. In the name of equality, the same types of member should be treated in the same way in similar situations. In practice, already the different legal status of members can make equal treatment difficult. In addition, even the roles of those who originally have the same status can change, when a hobby gains a self-employment aspect related to the sport, or the role changes e.g. from a regular competitor into a national team member. It’s impossible to include these role changes in the association’s rules, but somehow there should be association-level statutes and agreements about them as well. Especially at the federation level there should be a requirement, maybe as part of administrative rules, to record all rules and agreements etc. affecting the status of members on a separate document. Insofar as such an exception and significance has not been noted, the significance should be interpreted to be so minimal that there is no need to take it into consideration anywhere. No economic or other kind of additional benefits (such as the national team subsidy) should be granted unless the rules establish the special status (of the national team) entitling the member to the benefit. - On the other hand, no additional consequences, e.g. disciplinary consequences, that differ from other members’ could be defined unless the person’s role had been defined as a specific status with special obligations. - Without such an obligation to write down exceptions, it’s difficult to manage potential exceptions, and also difficult to prove it afterwards. Over the years, all sorts of irregular practices can form, while their origin and purpose remain inexplicable to future generations. Similarly, if someone has to demand their rights in disciplinary proceedings, it can be nearly impossible for them to understand in what kind of role their actions are judged. Sometimes this sort of self-evaluation can even be impossible due to lack of agreements or rules and/or contradictions in the rules. This can ultimately endanger an individual’s equal treatment and, in the worst case, even legal protection, even if it was pursued in court.","Equal treatment, rights, and duties of members",Large federations,Member types and their obligations,0,1,0,0,0,1,"1.	a large federation can have many types of members

In such a case, membership of, for example, the international federation or the Olympic Committee can create immediate commitments that also obligate member clubs and individual members. The strength of the commitment varies depending on the matter, but e.g. anti-doping commitments are subject to heavy sanctions and there is a great need for awareness. Even though athletes are required to have a personal license agreement, also other actors have obligations regardless of their lack of a license. These must be written down in an association’s rules at all levels, and not only in the competition rules.
- Another kind of commitment would be e.g. acting in accordance with the competition rules of the sport’s international federation. The international federation can change its rules independently of national decisions, and in practice does so. Commitments of this kind should be written down in the association’s or federation’s rules according to some logical principle. This actually is the case in practice, but as far as I understand it isn’t a legal obligation, even though it should be. On the other hand, many rules are also subject to national decision-making. From the point of view of the member, the most important thing is to be aware, at least on a general level, of where rules and practices stem from, if they affect them on a practical level. In my opinion, it’s especially important if the federation recognizes an international disciplinary power to which its members or recreational members are subject.

There are many other ways of doing it in addition to the one I proposed regarding the number of licenses. - So I don’t think it’s the only correct alternative, but an example, and a justified example. The contents of the law or decree will inevitably be general, and won’t go into these details. It’s up to completely different parties to think of other possible solutions. - In practice, when choosing points of view and making choices, you first have to consider the nature and operative principles of the federation. To me, it means that e.g. you consider both the equality of the federation’s members, i.e. clubs, as well as real involvement in the sport. A larger number of athletes must have more weight, also as it comes to voting rights. It’s also an economic question. When a club has more licenses, its membership fee is also higher. A small club with few licenses has a smaller membership fee, but if a large club has only a marginal number of members in our sport, it, too, has the same membership fee. On the other hand, even a large club can pay that small membership fee for its few athletes, since the cost multiplication factor doesn’t apply to its entire membership, but only to those actually involved in the sport. This also allows us not to let large clubs determine all decisions just because they are large. They must also be genuinely actively engaged in the sport, and the breadth of engagement gives power to influence the federation’s decisions. We want to involve both small and larger clubs, and that’s why you get one vote with just the membership fee.

The essential thing to understand is that nobody would be forced to introduce the institution of a managing director, but it would just be an option available for those associations that need it.

If smaller associations want to start misusing the institution of managing director, i.e. circumvent labor law protections, we should maybe consider whether it would be wisest to initially grant this possibility only, for example, to associations defined as large by the Accounting Act?

I’m not sure what the best alternative would be. But I think that these kinds of regulations would make the activities of many associations easier. The law can’t of course influence these things, but there should be more guidance to encourage 4th sector actors to join forces with a registered association (e.g. acting as local branches).

It’s of no use to anyone that an association with a budget of a couple of hundred makes financial statements - large-scale abuses can’t arise in such a context - defining responsibilities is essential in any case, also in the more informal model - administrative rules might in many cases be more useful than a law, so many things could be regulated by defining good practices - one reason people find the Associations Act cumbersome may be simply that people don’t understand what’s actually required in the end. So this understanding could be helped with a clear explanation. – responsibility accumulates to a couple of persons, and this scares the others. Could the informal model be that if nothing happens, then nothing happens and the activities are discontinued? What do you achieve by creating a less heavily regulated model? - the advantage of the more informal model is speed. If e.g. on Facebook you decide that you want to organize an event, the informal model is significantly quicker e.g. in terms of fundraising. – it would enable quick foundation and quick discontinuation – a revision of the Money Collection Act and a less heavily regulated association model would support each other.  - could you have an association that is subject to no obligations if there are no activities either?

As a basis for discussion, there are proposals that would facilitate the voluntary identification of such groups. In addition, there are proposals on e.g. membership, decision-making and access to information in such groups, and the responsibility of group representatives and members. Underneath every proposal, there are sample justifications and issues that still need further consideration.

Another issue, the legal competence of groups of actors: a citizen has a basic duty to look into the provisions associated with their activities, you can’t count ignorance as a mitigating factor if your activities happen to violate provisions. Therefore, unregistered associations and groups must also know the Associations Act. Model rules are just an easy way to offer a ready, though-out solution to the issue of drafting rules in order to begin activities.
That alternative option thing is the same one I’ve already raised in other contexts: I think in the provisions as well as in model rules, you should avoid sentences where the subsidiary clause renders the main clause void; e.g. “unless otherwise agreed”.",model rules for informal groups,,,1,1,0,1,0,1,"• citizens and groups are responsible for knowing relevant laws, but model rules would help them

Often, they say: If this isn’t mentioned in the rules, follow the Associations Act. There are various model rules for different kinds of activities. When young boys found a soccer team, they have to found and register it as a non-profit association if they want to hire pitches from the municipality. Otherwise they have zero interest in association activities. They don’t have much information, if any, on Finnish legislation yet, let alone that there is an Associations Act regulating the activities of their association. I’ve seen a lot of this when working in the field, and young people aren’t the only ones not interested in the contents of the Associations Act. You always have to remember this when discussing associations. Associations, especially small ones, don’t have a lot of competence in association activities. Earlier this wasn’t that big a problem, because the Register of Associations had customer service that helped associations with everyday difficulties. But when the Register of Associations was merged with the Trade Register operations, everybody was told that customer service was no longer part of their tasks except for associations whose notifications are being processed, and even then, only in matters regarding that notification. I myself have gotten a reply form them saying that providing advice is no longer one of their core tasks. I think it’s a great loss. Companies have management and administration skills because it’s part of their basic tasks. Non-profit associations and their officials aren’t professionals in the administration of an association. Now they have nowhere to turn to for advice because only some of them can afford to buy e.g. legal services. This maybe isn’t the correct place to comment on it, but it’s a huge change to the approach of the past over 90 years.",model rules for informal groups,the associations act,public knowledge of laws and regulations,1,0,0,1,0,0,"• rules for groups may be covered under the associations act

Many registered associations are facing difficulties because they can’t find new members. People don’t necessarily have the energy to take care of tasks related to the administration of an association during their free time. I myself have, after many years, reduced the time I spend on administrative tasks, even though I know it’s important. After all, it’s nice to do things for the common good. Organize events or have an impact. I think it would increase volunteering and activism if official possibilities for action and identification can be developed. Instead of founding an association, could a minimum of three people sign up somewhere, say in the Register of Associations, as an informally organized group of actors? The economic responsibility would legally be theirs. If they want their statements to be representative, they could collect names, like for a petition. During my time at Vanhempainliitto, when I provided support for founding parents’ associations and gave advice for associations, I occasionally felt that the official nature of the activities and of choosing an executive committee diminished participation.

Under the Act on General Upper Secondary Education, the education provider must guarantee sufficient conditions for the activities of the student union. These conditions include appropriately organizing monetary transactions, which, however, isn’t currently possible for all student unions. Registering as an association would narrow student unions’ democracy, because most upper secondary school students are minors, and therefore a very limited number of them can run for a position in the executive committee of an association. The biggest problem is in fact created by the management of funds. Moving financial management behind the authority of a guiding teacher or principal changes the students’ actual power to decide on how to use the student union’s fund.
