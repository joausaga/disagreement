Pohdin, erotetaanko osallistuminen ja päätöksenteko toinen toisistaan tai kuinka näiden yhteyttä vahvistetaan. Esimerkiksi Maailman toimivin kaupunki tai Nuorten netti ovat hyviä avoimia ja viestinnällisesti perusteltuja aloitepalveluja.

So accessibility will also concern the digital services that will be updated based on the new Associations Act. Existing services are inaccessible, so they don’t comply with legal requirements.
Since not all people with disabilities can use digital services, they have to file all notices using paper forms. At present, their prices violate the Non-discrimination Act for people with disabilities:
No disability

Most people with disabilities
Filing a notice of the founding of an association with a paper form (no preliminary rule check by the Patent and Registration office) €150

I know that the prices have been decided based on what is the quickest and cheapest way for the Patent and Registration Office to handle notices, but notices must not be priced based on handling costs so that they violate the Non-discrimination Act.

Tämä on osoittautunut käytännössä jonkinlaiseksi ongelmaksi ja tätä tulisi painottaa ja siihen velvoittaa. Verkkokokous voi vanhanaikaisena olla kestoltaan pitkäkin, jos se toteutetaan sähköpostina hajautetusti ja voi muistuttaa normaalia sähköpostien lähettelyä.  Oleellista on, että ennen päätöstä kaikki ovat informoituja asiasisällöistä, vaihtoehdoista ja ovat voineet ilmaista kantansa.  Oleellista ei siis ole sallia tai rajata mitään kokousmallia pois vaan pitää säädöksin huolta siitä, että päätöksenteon edellytykset ovat kunnossa ja toimivat tasapuolisesti. Sähköisen kokoustavan mallit vaihtelevat, mutta tulee varmistaa, että riittävä realiaikaisuus toteutuu ja käytettävät sähköiset palvelut ovat kohtuuhintaisia ja riittävän yleisiä. Täysin realiaikainen kokoustaminen on tietysti toimivinta, mutta kaikilla sähköisillä työkaluilla se ei tosiasiassa onnistu. Mikäli järjestön kokous toteutetaan sähköisesti, tuon kokoustavan kohtuullinen kuvaus tulisi liittää pöytäkirjakohdaksi.

In practice, this has proved to be a bit of a problem, which should be highlighted, and made into a requirement. In its old-fashioned form, an online meeting can be quite long if it’s done in a decentralized way by email, and can be very similar to normal emailing. The main thing is that before a decision is taken, everyone has been informed of the content of the decision and of the alternatives and has been able to express their opinion. So the key point is not to allow or forbid specific kinds of meeting, but to ensure with provisions that the necessary conditions for decision-making are fulfilled, and that they work equitably. Digital meeting method models vary, but we must ensure they are sufficiently in real-time, and that the digital services used are moderately priced and sufficiently commonly used. Holding a meeting completely in real time is, of course, the best solution, but not one all digital tools can deliver in practice. If the association’s meeting is held digitally, a sufficient description of the meeting method should be added as an item in the minutes.

Verkkokouksen hyväksyttäviä toteutusvaihtoehtoja ei ole tarkoituksenmukaista rajata. Lainsäädännön tulisi olla teknologianeutraali. Muiden yhteisömuotojen etäosallistumista koskevassa lainsäädännössä edellytetään vain, että osallistumisoikeus ja äänten laskennan oikeellisuus voiddaan selvittää perinteiseen kokoukseen verrattavalla tavalla tavalla ja että kokouskutsussa on mainittava tällaisesta osallistumismahdollisuudesta, sen käyttämisen edellytyksistä, siinä noudatettavasta menettelystä ja siihen liittyvistä mahdollisista puhevallan rajoituksista. 

Kokonaan verkossa tapahtuvan kokouksen osalta on ymmärrettävästi ratkaistava myös edellä tässä viestiketjussa mainitut (ja muitakin asioita), koska verkkokouksessahan jäsenillä ei ole vaihtoehtona perinteistä osallistumismahdollisuutta.

",0,,,,"Karin: I actually don’t exactly know all of the areas in which our federation has had problems with addresses, because I don’t take care of the practical side of this issue. In general, there are problems in several areas of our activities. From a legal standpoint or regarding the possibility of contestation, the most critical problem is the letters or emails sent by the federation to its member associations, for example an invitation to the annual meeting.  Member associations’ contact persons change often, and the official address with them. There have been missing contact details both in the register of associations and in providing new contact details directly to the federation, which is quicker. In one association, we couldn’t find the official recipient with any of the ordinary means from the register of associations or the club’s website or similar, and yet they made a complaint about the message’s arrival. The association’s official contact person had had a non-disclosure of address information, although I’m not sure which services that concerned. If a natural person is a member, it’s up to them whether their contact details are available. What I’m talking about concerns member associations. We just can’t have a situation in which the designated contact person who is the official recipient of all mail does not have any address information available. This situation could be solved by having all associations included in the register of associations have an official online post address with Posti. You could send official material there even though the recipient would change. The system would be even better if it could react simultaneously with the register of associations, so that the same system could also keep a record of those authorized to sign on behalf of associations. Associations would at least react when important mail wouldn’t turn up to the correct recipients but would go to previous committee members. - Licenses ensure that athletes’ information is in the license system, which has the necessary encryption thanks to the professional competence of the Olympic Committee. But in our case, licensed athletes aren’t members of the federation, but of the clubs. According to the rules, we don’t even need to send them official meeting invitations.

Just today, one athlete told me that when they became president, the information for their association in the register of associations wasn’t their predecessor’s, nor their predecessor’s predecessor’s, but of the person before them. In one case, an association’s previous president decided not to cooperate, and threw away the mail that had arrived at the old address without mentioning it to anyone else.  A few years ago, I myself got a letter addressed to the local branch of our association, sent by a bank that had been provided with the new address information plenty of times. I hadn’t acted as treasurer in this association since the early 2000s. So address changes do often create problems. The aim of my idea is for associations to have an address that would stay the same for decades and that could always be correctly linked. It would also make it easier to create a digital archive or other service, and the information wouldn’t remain in anyone’s personal email. For a normal online service, people change their service provider very often, and associations considerably often, too. That’s why, at least in my opinion, NetPosti would represent a more permanent operator.

Siinä vaiheessa, kun kuvaan astuu jossain määrin julkinen rahoitus tai muu julkinen säätely, muuttuu toiminnan vakavuuden aste. Hallituksen jäsenten ja toimihenkilöiden huolellisuusvelvoitteet yhteiskunnan suuntaan tiukkenevat selkeästi. Valvojan rooli kasvaa ja pelkkä toiminnan toteuttaminen ei riitä. Koska julkisen edun valvontavelvollisuus yhdistyksen edustajien toimesta on kuitenkin de facto, tulisi sekin selkeämmin tuoda yhdistyslaissa ilmi. Oikeastaan on surullista, että joillekin hallituksen jäsenille tälläisen valvonnan hoitamattomuuden mukanaan tuomat seuraamukset voivat tulla yllätyksenä. Toisaalta valtionhallinnon tehdessä yhdistyksiä koskevia tukipäätöksiä, olisi hyvä, jos samassa yhteydessä riittävästi liitetietoina tuotaisiin esiin ne velvoitteet, joita kyseiseen tukeen liittyy ja mitä yhdistyksen toimielimiltä sillä perusteella edellytetään.  Minusta kaikki valtion tai kuntien antamat tukipäätökset tulisi liittää yhdistyksen vuosikokousmateriaaliin. Nyt niistä yleensä mainitaan summat eikä mitään muita ehtoja tai sisältöjä.

Committee members’ and officials’ duty of care towards society becomes much stricter. The role of oversight increases, and just running the usual activities is no longer enough. Since the association representatives have a de facto duty to look after public interest, that, too, should be more clearly stated in the Associations Act. It’s actually sad that for some executive committee members, the consequences of failing to attend to this duty can come as a surprise. On the other hand, when the government makes funding decisions concerning associations, it would be good if in the same context you’d state, as additional information, the obligations associated with the funding in question, and the obligations it places on the association’s decision-making bodies. I think all state or municipality funding decisions should be appended to associations’ annual meeting materials.

Laissa voi olla vaatimus myös siitä, että sääntöihin tulee kirjata mm missä asioissa ja miten tasa-arvon tulee tuoda ilmi. Yhdistyksen kaikissa järjestön perussääntöä alemmissakin sääntökokoelmissa tulisi silloin selvitä, miten tasa-arvoa sen toiminnan alueella ilmennetään. Näin saataisiin vaikutukselle myös syvyyttä ja kattavuutta. Yleinen taso yhdistyssäännöissä ja alempaa sovellutusta vaikkapa kilpailusäännössä. Samoi silloin on mahdollista kiinnittää huomiots myös tasa-arvon eri ilmenemismuotoihin kuten vaikkapa alueelliseen tasa-arvoon ja miten sen pitäisi näkyä käytännön työssä.

- Yhdistyksen toimintaa ohjataan säännöin ja periaattein. 
- Säännöillä tulisi olla selkeä hierarkkia ja laissa kannattaa kiinnittää minusta huomioita järjestösääntöön (käyttämäni termi on huono ja sillekin pitäisi olla joku kaikkien hyväksymä ja käyttämä yleisnimi - mikä se on?) ylimpänä tasona  ja seuraavana tasona hallintosääntöön ja kurinpitosääntöön. Hallintosäännön olemassa olo olisi mielestäni minimivaatimus sellaisilla järjestöillä, joilla on toiminnassaan mukana yli 500 jäsentä.  Kurinpitosääntö tulisi olla ainakin sellaisilla järjestöillä, joilla on lisenssiurheilijoita tai joiden toiminnassa on mukana yli 1000 jäsentä.
- Koska yhdistystoiminta ei todellakaan ole pelkkiä sääntöjä - onneksi, - tulisi huomioida jotenkin sääntöjä laajemmin myös niitä periaatteita, joita halutaan seurata. Näidenkin osalta moni asia tulee jo järjestön ylemmistä sitoumuksista. Niinpä ""Urheilun Reilun Pelin Periaatteet"" (- säännöt) on monelle tuttu ainakin ideatasolla. ""Hyvä koiranpitotapa"" on kennelihmisille tuttu ainakin terminä, mitä ikinä se sitten merkitseekin. Myös vaikkapa OKM:n hallinnolta tulee periaatteita, joita järjestöissä odotetaan noudatettavan. - Urheilun oikeusturvalautakunta edustaa käsittääkseni ajatusta (jos olen oikein ymmärtänyt), että kurinpitomenettelyssä tulee sopivassa laajuudessa huomioida rikosoikeudellisia periaatteita, (vaikka missään tapauksessa kyseessä ei ole rikosprosessi - sitä en tarkoita). Jos noita periaatteita ei mietitä, niin kurinpidossa voidaan mennä metsään.  
- Mielestäni järjestöiltä voitaisiin edellyttää niille tärkeiden periaatteiden kirjaamista, silloin kun niihin halutaan vedota käytännön työssä ja päätöksissä. Itse olen vankkumaton periaatteiden kirjaamisen kannattaja. Moni ongelmatilanne järjestötyössä ollaan pystytty ratkaisemaan, kun ollaan voitu tehdä tilannearviointia peilaamalla ajankohtaista asiaa sovittuihin periaatteisiin. Huonoin mahdollinen ratkaisu syntyy yleensä, kun tehdä tilannekohtainen päätös ilman yleistä linjaa. Siksi laissa tulisi uhrata pykälä järjestön periaatteidenkin merkityksen selkeyttämiseksi.
",0,,,,"The law can also contain a requirement for the rules to state e.g.  where and how equality should be manifested. Then all the association’s sets of rules, also those below the organization’s statutes, should state how equality is reflected in its activities. This way, the impact would be also profound and wide-ranging. The general level would be covered by the association’s rules, and the lower-level implementation would be in e.g. competition rules. Equally, then it would also be possible to draw attention to different aspects of equality, such as regional equality, and how that should be visible in the association’s daily work.
- The activities of an association are governed by rules and principles.
- The rules should have a clear hierarchy, and I think the law should consider association statutes (the term I use here is bad and there is some generally accepted and used word for it - what is it?) as the highest level, and administrative and disciplinary rules as the next level. I think it should be a minimum requirement for all associations with over 500 members to have administrative rules in existence. Disciplinary rules should be a requirement at least for organizations with licensed athletes or over 1000 members.
- Because association activities (fortunately) involve a lot more than just rules, you should go beyond rules and somehow also consider the association’s guiding principles. Many of these, too, are often already determined by the organization’s higher-level commitments. So the “Principles of Fair Play in Sport” (rules) are familiar to many, at least on the level of ideas. People with kennels are familiar with “good dog ownership” at least as a term, whatever it means. Also e.g. the Ministry of Education and Culture defines principles that associations are expected to follow.
- I believe the sports arbitration board represents the thought (if I’ve understood correctly) that disciplinary proceedings must take the principles of criminal law into account to the extent that it is appropriate (even though they are by no means criminal proceedings - that’s not what I mean). If you give no thought to those principles, then discipline can go badly wrong.
- I think you could require associations to write down their guiding principles, when you want to refer to them in daily work and decisions. I myself am a firm supporter of writing down principles. Many difficult situations in associations have been solved by assessing the situation by looking at the issue at hand in relation to agreed-upon principles. The worst possible solution usually happens when a situation-specific decision is made without a general policy. That’s why you should spare a section in the law for clarifying the importance of the principles of an association.

Osa voi olla yhdistyksiä, osa yrityksiä, osa luonnollisia henkilöitä. Yhdenvertaisuuden nimissä samanlaisia jäseniä tulee vastaavissa tilanteissa kohdella samalla tavalla. Käytännössä jo jäsenten erilainen juridinen status aiheuttaa vaikeuksia yhdenvertaisuuden toteutumiselle. Lisäksi samankin alkuperäisstatuksen omaavien roolit voivat muuttua, kun vaikkapa harrastukseen tuleekin lajiin liittyvä ammatinharjoittamisen näkökulma tai rooli muuttuu vaikkapa tavallisesta kilpailijasta maajoukkue-edustajaksi. Näitä roolimuutoksia ei mitenkään ole mahdollista kirjata yhdistyksen sääntöihin, mutta jotenkin niistäkin tulisi kirjata yhdistystystason säädöksiä ja sopimuksia. Varsinkin liittotasolla tulisikin edellyttää, ehkä hallintosäännön osana, että kaikista jäsenistön asemaan vaikuttavista säännöistä ja sopimuksista tmv. tulisi pitää erillistä dokumenttia. Siltä osin, kun tällaista poikkeavuutta ja merkitystä ei ole kirjattu, toimittakoon niin kuin merkitys olisi niin vähäpätöinen, ettei sitä ole syytä missään huomioida. Mitään taloudellista tai muutakaan ylimääräistä etua (vaikkapa maajoukkuetuki) ei tulisi myöntää, jollei (maajoukkueen) erityisasemasta olisi sellaista kirjausta, joka tuohon tukeen oikeuttaisi. - Toisaalta mitään muista jäsenistä poikkeavia lisäseuraamuksia vaikkapa kurinpidosta ei voitaisi määritellä, jollei henkilön roolia olisi määritelty tiettyyn erityisvelvoittavaan statukseen. - Ilman tällaista kirjaamisvelvoitetta mahdollisten poikkeavuuksien hallinta on vaikeaa ja jälkikäteen myös vaikeaa todentaa. Vuosien varrella voi syntyä mitä villeimpiä käytäntöjä, joiden alkuperä ja tarkoitus jää tuleville sukupolville arvoitukseksi. Samoin, jos joku joutuu peräämään oikeuksiaan kurinpitomenettelyn yhteydessä, hänen voi olla vaikea mitenkään hahmottaa, minkälaisesta roolista hänen tekemisiään arvioidaan. Joskus tällainen itsearviointi voi olla sopimusten puuttuessa tai sääntöjen puutteen ja/tai ristiriitaisuuksien takia jopa mahdotonta. Silloin voi vaarantua myös yksilön tasavertainen kohtelu ja huonoimmillaan jopa oikeusturva, vaikka sitä haettaisiin tuomioistuimessa.",1,stina.koivisto@eslu.fi,,,"A large federation can have many types of member. Some may be associations, some companies, some natural persons. In the name of equality, the same types of member should be treated in the same way in similar situations. In practice, already the different legal status of members can make equal treatment difficult. In addition, even the roles of those who originally have the same status can change, when a hobby gains a self-employment aspect related to the sport, or the role changes e.g. from a regular competitor into a national team member. It’s impossible to include these role changes in the association’s rules, but somehow there should be association-level statutes and agreements about them as well. Especially at the federation level there should be a requirement, maybe as part of administrative rules, to record all rules and agreements etc. affecting the status of members on a separate document. Insofar as such an exception and significance has not been noted, the significance should be interpreted to be so minimal that there is no need to take it into consideration anywhere. No economic or other kind of additional benefits (such as the national team subsidy) should be granted unless the rules establish the special status (of the national team) entitling the member to the benefit. - On the other hand, no additional consequences, e.g. disciplinary consequences, that differ from other members’ could be defined unless the person’s role had been defined as a specific status with special obligations. - Without such an obligation to write down exceptions, it’s difficult to manage potential exceptions, and also difficult to prove it afterwards. Over the years, all sorts of irregular practices can form, while their origin and purpose remain inexplicable to future generations. Similarly, if someone has to demand their rights in disciplinary proceedings, it can be nearly impossible for them to understand in what kind of role their actions are judged. Sometimes this sort of self-evaluation can even be impossible due to lack of agreements or rules and/or contradictions in the rules. This can ultimately endanger an individual’s equal treatment and, in the worst case, even legal protection, even if it was pursued in court.","Equal treatment, rights, and duties of members",Large federations,Member types and their obligations,0,1,0,0,0,1,"	1.	a large federation can have many types of members

Sitoumuksen vahvuus vaihtelee asiakohtaisesti, mutta vaikkapa doping-sitoumukset ovat kovien sanktioiden alaisia ja tiedostamisen tarve suuri. Vaikka urheilijoilta edellytetään henkilökohtaista lisenssisitoumusta, myös muilla toimijoilla on velvoitteita lisenssin puuttumisesta huolimatta.

Tämän kaltaiset sitoumukset tulisi olla kirjattuna yhdistyksen tai lajiliiton säännöissä jollain loogisella periaatteella. Käytännössä näin onkin, mutta käsittääkseni laki ei siihen velvoita, vaikka syytä olisikin. Toisaalta paljon sääntöjä on myös kansallisen päätöksenteon alla. Jäsenen kannalta tärkeintä on tiedostaa edes yleisellä tasolla, mistä säännöt ja käytännöt ovat johdettavissa, mikäli ne koskevat käytännön tasolla häntä itseään.

Even though athletes are required to have a personal license agreement, also other actors have obligations regardless of their lack of a license. These must be written down in an association’s rules at all levels, and not only in the competition rules.
- Another kind of commitment would be e.g. acting in accordance with the competition rules of the sport’s international federation. The international federation can change its rules independently of national decisions, and in practice does so. Commitments of this kind should be written down in the association’s or federation’s rules according to some logical principle. This actually is the case in practice, but as far as I understand it isn’t a legal obligation, even though it should be. On the other hand, many rules are also subject to national decision-making. From the point of view of the member, the most important thing is to be aware, at least on a general level, of where rules and practices stem from, if they affect them on a practical level.

Klassinen yhdenvertaisuuden loukkausperuste on esim. kunniajäsenyys, joka vapauttaa jäsenmaksusta ja josta siis olisi jatkossakin syytä olla merkintä säännöissä.
Sitten uudempi keskustelu on koskenut tarvetta jonkinlaiseen ""peukutus/kevytjäsenyyteen"", joka muistuttaa ehkä enemmän tukilahjoitusta kuin varsinaista jäsenyyttä.
Tässä siis muutamia esimerkkejä mahdolisista tarpeista poiketa pääsäännöstä säännöissä.
Minusta yhdenvertaisuuden nimenomainen maininta laissa perusperiaatteena on hyvä. Lain esitöissä voidaan kuvata, ettei merkinnällä tavoitella radikaalia muutosta nykytilaan vaan vain asian selkiyttämistä?
",0,,,,"A classic justification for the violation of equality is e.g. honorary membership, which exempts from membership fees, and which should therefore be mentioned in the rules also in the future.
Then the more recent discussion has concerned the need for some kind of “supporter/light membership”, which maybe resembles a supportive donation rather than an actual membership.
So these are a couple of examples of possible necessary exceptions to the main rule in the rules. I think specifically mentioning equality in the law as a foundational principle is a good thing. The preparatory work for the law can explain that this specification is not intended as a radical change to the present situation but just as a clarification?

Useissa keskusteluissa on viime aikoina mietitty tavallista ""halvelmpaa"" tukijäsenyyttä ikään kuin minilahjoituksen rinnalle. Tällöin oltaisiin jotenkin messissä, muttei esim. jäsenlehti/ osallistumismaksusubventiot välttämättä kuuluisi ""pakettiin"". 


Tarve kevytjäsenyyteen on noussut myös siitä, että vähenevän väen paikkakunnilla hieman toisiaan sivuavat yhditykset voisivat helpommin yhdistyä paikallisessa toiminnassa siten, että jokainen jäisi varsinaiseksi jäseneksi omaan liittoonsa, mutta saisi ikäänkuin yhteistyöjäsenyyden halvemmalla myös toisesta liitosta.

With this type of membership you’d be in some way involved, but e.g. a membership magazine or participation cost subsidies wouldn’t necessarily be part of the “package”.

The need for a lighter form of membership has also risen from how it would make it easier for associations working in similar or connected fields in areas with declining populations to unite, so that everyone would remain a full member of their own association, but would get a kind of cheaper co-operation membership also from the other association.

So this is a very different idea from the current supporter membership, which is often an exceptionally expensive “donor/honorary membership”.

Monia muitakin tapoja on, kuin mitä esitin lisenssien määrien osalta. - En siis pidä sitä ainoana vaihtoehtona vaan esimerkkinä ja perusteltuna sellaisena. Lain tai asetuksen sisältö on vääjäämättä yleinen, eikä mene näihin yksityiskohtiin. Muita mahdollisia tapoja voivat aivan muut tahot miettiä - Käytännössä näkökulmia ja valintoja tehtäessä tulee ensisijaisesti arvioida sitä, mikä on lajiliiton luonne ja toimintaperiaate. Minulle se tarkoittaa mm. sitä, että mietitään sekä lajiliiton jäsenten eli seurojen tasa-arvoa, mutta myös sitä, että oikea lajiharrastuneisuus näkyy. Suuremmalla määrällä harrastajia pitää olla suurempi merkitys myös äänivallassa. Kyseessä on myös talous. Kun on enemmän lisenssejä on myös suurempi jäsenmaksu. Pieni seura, jossa on vähän lisenssejä pääsee pienemmällä jäsenmaksulla, mutta jos suuren seuran toiminnassa meidän lajilla on vain marginaalinen harrastajamäärä, senkin jäsenmaksu on sama.  Toisaalta isokin seura voi maksaa tuon pienen jäsenmaksun harvojen harrastajiensa osalta, kun kustannuskertoimet eivät kohdistu koko sen jäsenmassaan vaan ainoastaan aitoihin lajiharrastajiin. Emme myöskään näin päästä isoja seuroja määrittelemään päätöksiä vain siksi, että ne ovat isoja. Niillä tulee olla myös aidosti lajitoimintaa ja lajitoiminnan laajuus antaa vaikutusvaltaa lajiliiton päätöksiin. Haluamme mukaan niin pienet kuin suuretkin seurat siksi yhden äänen saa pelkällä jäsenmaksulla. (anteeksi tämä turhakin yksityiskohtien erittely)",0,,,,"My original comment was about how the character of different voting rights should be somehow distinguished in the law, and this was one example. There are many other ways of doing it in addition to the one I proposed regarding the number of licenses. - So I don’t think it’s the only correct alternative, but an example, and a justified example. The contents of the law or decree will inevitably be general, and won’t go into these details. It’s up to completely different parties to think of other possible solutions. - In practice, when choosing points of view and making choices, you first have to consider the nature and operative principles of the federation. To me, it means that e.g. you consider both the equality of the federation’s members, i.e. clubs, as well as real involvement in the sport. A larger number of athletes must have more weight, also as it comes to voting rights. It’s also an economic question. When a club has more licenses, its membership fee is also higher. A small club with few licenses has a smaller membership fee, but if a large club has only a marginal number of members in our sport, it, too, has the same membership fee. On the other hand, even a large club can pay that small membership fee for its few athletes, since the cost multiplication factor doesn’t apply to its entire membership, but only to those actually involved in the sport. This also allows us not to let large clubs determine all decisions just because they are large. They must also be genuinely actively engaged in the sport, and the breadth of engagement gives power to influence the federation’s decisions.

Koska puhumme jäsenistä ja heidän yhdenvertaisuudestaan, pidän kuitenkin tärkeänä, että Suomessa Suomen lain alaisesti toimivissa yhdistyksissä edelleenkin yli puolten jäsenistä olisi oltava Suomen kansalaisia. Muussa tapauksessa olisi yhdistyksen perustamisessa ajateltava yhdistyksen perustamista maahan, jossa enemmistö on kyseisen maan kansalaisia. Kansainvälisesti toimivat, isommat yhdistykset perustavat varmaankin osastoja (yhdistyksiä)  maihin, joissa heillä on toimintaa. Lisäksi näin he voivat hajauttaa vastuitaan. 
Toinen asia on yhdenvertaisuus ääntenlaskennassa: näen että yhdistys voi itse päättää äänten painotuksesta, mutta ohjeistukseen voi edelleenkin suositella ""jokaisella jäsenellä on yksi ääni.""

Nykymaailmassa tällainen  ehto on aika hankala. Kansalaisuuden saaminen on yhä edelleen varsin vaikeaa.

Tällaisista on varsinkin politiikan kentällä ollut paljonkin kirjoittelua viime aikoina. 

Vuoteen 1968 olin itse useiden tämän maan yhdistysten jäsenenä, mm. yhdessä varapuheenjohtajana, toisessa rahastonhoitajana, kolmannessa sihteerinä, Ruotsin kansalaisena (sitten vaihdoin Suomen kansalaisuuteen).

"Members’ decision-making and rights

In this discussion, the topics are association members’ decision-making and rights. As a basis for discussion, there are proposals that could e.g. facilitate the use of online services in members’ decision-making and access to information. Underneath every proposal, there are sample justifications and issues that still need further consideration.

You can participate by commenting on the proposals, replying to comments and liking them. You can also put forward brand-new proposals - the discussion does not deal with taxation, labor legislation, public aid, permits for activities, and other similar changes in regulations regarding the practicalities of association activities.
